### Statement  
The basic idea is to use AVL tree/regular tree to create a dungeon crawler in which we use the image libraries to display monsters to the player,and based on the level of the tree the user is on the difficulty of the monster the player will be able to obtain more epxerience to level up and go to higher difficulties.The reason this is interesting personally is because dungeon crawlers are simple but can be difficult and entertaining at the same time.We hope to learn how to use what we have previosly learned and apply it in different ways such as using lambda to create a way to calculate accuracy, create a random number generator for player stat gain such as health,mana.

### Analysis  
We will use object orientation for the initial creation of the lower levels of the tree to control the beggining difficulty of the game and for the final boss of the game this way we can control the begging and end of the enviroment everything else is left to the player.

### Data set or other source materials
The data that we will be working on will be writen by ourselves.

### Deliverable and Demonstration
Explain exactly what you'll have at the end. What will it be able to do at the live demo?

What exactly will you produce at the end of the project? A piece of software, yes, but what will it do? Here are some questions to think about (and answer depending on your application).

Will it run on some data, like batch mode? Will you present some analytical results of the processing? How can it be re-run on different source data?

Will it be interactive? Can you show it working? This project involves a live demo, so interactivity is good.

### Evaluation of Results
How will you know if you are successful? 
If you include some kind of _quantitative analysis,_ that would be good.

## Architecture Diagram
Upload the architecture diagram you made for your slide presentation to your repository, and include it in-line here.

Create several paragraphs of narrative to explain the pieces and how they interoperate.

## Schedule

### First Milestone (Fri Apr 15)  

Traversing through the dungeon(tree)  
GUI for showing Monsters using Images library (optional)  

### Second Milestone (Fri Apr 22)  

Create monster objects and their parameters  
Modification of Player object with lambda functions  

### Final Presentation (last week of semester)

Aplication of Encounter options  

## Group Responsibilities
Here each group member gets a section where they, as an individual, detail what they are responsible for in this project. Each group member writes their own Responsibility section. Include the milestones and final deliverable.
